title: About Jamie
---

I am a student from Coventry University, I have graduated from BSc Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security with a first-class honour and I am now continuing onto MSc Cyber Security. I have been doing Computing starting in college and continued that into security then into hacking, since then I have stated university and beginning my first and final year at university.
In my own time I play a lot of games however I also love to study which is why I have created this website, because I would like to go over my studies; primarily my capture the flag events and ones provided by websites such as TryHackMe.com and HackTheBox.com. I have dabbled in lots of areas of IT some of which I have enjoyed thoroughly such as web design and building as well as programming (Python and C); I am currently trying to go in more depth with Python and C, but I am also trying to learn a few more such as Rust, Node/JS and the other C’s (C++ and C#).
I have also built computers and done IT support which included repairs as well as basic guides and installs for beginner users. I am currently looking for an opportunity within the offensive security area however I am not fussy for jobs as I do enjoy defensive security as well, my outlook is "if you are happy continue what you want to do”.
