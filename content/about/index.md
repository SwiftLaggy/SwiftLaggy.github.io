title: About Jamie
---

During my time at Coventry University, I explored facets of cyber security and ethical hacking, in which I proudly earned a first-class honours. This was followed by a master's degree in the same field of cyber security. I became interested in and started practicing computing back in 2014, which continued throughout college. This opened me up to the realm of cyber security and, in time, ethical hacking.  <br/>
<br/>
Outside of my academic pursuits, I spend my time gaming, but I also love to learn and study. That's why I decided to create this website - to enable me to possess a virtual space to reflect on my academic journey and progress, primarily my capture the flag events and challenges provided by websites such as TryHackMe.com and HackTheBox.com. This website also allows me to showcase any ongoing projects that I am currently doing. This will serve as a method of tracking my own progression, while also offering the potential to  help others who are on similar paths to me. <br/>
<br>
I am well versed in many areas of IT, and my knowledge in these areas are diverse. From experimenting with web design and programming (Python and C). I am currently attempting to delve deeper with Python and C, while also exploring new languages such as Rust, Node/JS and C++ and C#. <br/>
<br>
My interests extend beyond coding. I have successfully built computers from scratch and have provided IT support. This encompasses assisting with repairs and supplying basic guides and installs for beginner users. Looking forward, I am determined to enter the field of offensive security, though I remain open to jobs on the defensive security side. My philosophy is simple "Follow your passions, and success will follow." <br/>
