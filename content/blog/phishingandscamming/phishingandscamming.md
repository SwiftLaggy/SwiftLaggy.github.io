## **What is Scamming?**

A scam is when someone tricks you into giving them money or something valuable in a dishonest or illegal way.

## Different types of scams

**Cost of living scams**:

Scammers are exploiting the cost of living crisis to trick people into giving them money. Here are some common scams:

- **Fake Messages**: Scammers send texts or emails pretending to be from the government, offering tax rebates or grants.
- **False Products**: They sell fake energy-saving products or misleading information about home insulation.
- **Financial Scams**: These include investment scams, courier fraud, and illegal lending.
- **Fake Goods**: Scammers create ads on social media for cheap products that don’t exist.

**Stay Safe**:

- Know what help is available and who to trust.
- Remember, cost of living payments and the Energy Bills Support scheme have ended. If you get messages about these, assume they are scams.
- To get extra help, contact your local authority, not someone asking for your bank details.

**Investment scams**:

Investment fraud can be complex and much harder to spot.

- Scammers may call or email you about investments that promise high returns.
- They may seem knowledgeable and create a sense of urgency.
- **What to Do**: Hang up or close the door. Legitimate companies don’t reach out like this. Always seek independent financial advice before investing.

**Stay Safe**:

- Always get impartial, independent financial or legal advice before making any investments. You can find an Independent Financial Adviser through the Society of Later Life Advisers (SOLLA).

- The [Financial Conduct Authority’s ScamSmart](https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart) hub has more information about investment scams. They have a warning list, so you can check if companies that contact you are genuine. 

**Pension Scams**:

- If you're over 55, scammers may contact you offering free pension reviews or high-return investments.
- It’s illegal for someone to cold call you about your pension.
- **What to Do**: Don’t engage with these calls. If you lose money, you will not get it back.

**Stay Safe**:

- The [Pensions Regulator](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en) has more information on pension scams. For free, impartial advice about how to invest your pension pot, visit [Pension Wise](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement/pension-wise).

**Phone scams**
**Courier fraud**:

Scammers pose as bank or police officials, asking for your PIN or card. They may:

- Claim to see a suspicious payment.
- Keep you on the line when you call back.
- Ask for your PIN or send someone to collect your card.

**What to Do**:

- Wait 20 minutes before calling your bank back.
- Never share your PIN.

There are many different ways this scam might happen. For example, a scammer may say it’s an undercover operation, so you must not tell your bank or the police. They might ask you to transfer all your funds into a ‘safe account’. They might also ask you to buy an expensive item to help them identify fake goods.

**Fake computer support calls**:

Someone may call claiming to be from an electronics company, like Microsoft, Apple, or a local service. They’ll tell you there’s a problem with your computer, and offer to fix it for a fee. They may also ask to take control of your computer. If you give them access, they’ll try to find out personal information, like your passwords and account details.

Microsoft, Apple and similar firms will never call you. If you receive a call like this, hang up.

**Email scams**:

Common scams include:
- **Prize Scams**: You can’t win money you didn’t enter for. Ignore any emails asking for fees.
- **Phishing Emails**: Don’t give your bank details; these may lead to fake websites.
- **Advance Fee Fraud**: Emails claiming you’ve inherited money or need to help someone move valuables are scams.
- **Inheritance emails** - a scammer will contact you and say someone has left you money in a will. You will have to send an administration fee to get the money
- **Fake Offer Emails** -  emails offering miracle cures and medications from online pharmacies.

**What to Do**:  
Delete unknown emails and report suspicious ones. You can also forward emails to the company’s reporting email address which you’ll find on their website. You could also forward suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk.

**Doorstep scams**
**Bogus Callers**:

These are people pretending to be workers from utilities or charities. They may:
- Ask to use your phone or check your meters.
- Have fake IDs.

**What to Do**:
- Don’t let strangers in.
- Always check IDs by calling the company directly.

**Rogue Traders**:  

They pressure you to buy or fix things quickly.

**What to Do**:
- Take your time. Check their credentials.
- set up a utilities password so you can check the caller is genuine
- put up a ‘no cold callers’ sign - If you think it is suspicious, call the police
- Check that anyone selling door to door has a valid pedlar's certificate issued by the police

**Relationship scams**:

Scammers may use dating sites to ask for money or personal information. Be cautious if someone:
- Asks personal questions but shares little.
- Rushes you to communicate off-site.
- Tells a hard-luck story asking for money.

**What to Do**:  
Never send money or personal details to someone you haven't met in person.

**Fraud recovery scams**:

If you’ve been scammed, be wary of companies offering to help you get your money back for a fee. This is often another scam.

**What to Do**:  
Report scams to [Action Fraud](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/)


**Real-life examples of scams and their impact**:

![Picture 1](../images/HMRCScam.jpg)

It is not shown in the image above, but sometimes, being messaged out of the blue by an unknown number, will show text underneath the chat. This will usually say "This sender is not in your contact list". Immediately, this lets you know that it is a potential scam from an unauthorised number. 
HMRC is a very large company, who make it a point to not send messages and will, instead, choose to send letters to your address to avoid possibilities of their customers potentially falling for a scam.
If the link is clicked, it will take you to a fake website, which could get you to input personal information, such as credit card details. This would give the attackers access to your bank account, resulting in a severe loss of money.  

![Picture 2](../images/RealLifeScam.jpg)

This is a simple, yet effective scam. It attempts to make you feel bad by giving a potential fake, sad story. They want you to give them money for their cause.

![Picture 3](../images/GiveawayScam.jpg)

This is a tricky scam, as some of these, are legit Facebook posts. From a professional standpoint, I would say that this is a scam. It tries to get you to like, share and comment, which are three types of engagement. This allows the poster to see that you are an active account. 
Additionally, these posts usually have a link to "find out more". Clicking these could potentially send you to a fake website, where your information may be stolen.
"Sharing" these posts allows others to fall for and be victim to these scams.
## Recognizing the Signs of Phishing and Scamming

**Have you been contacted out of the blue?**

Be suspicious of cold calls, emails, or messages asking for personal or payment details. Legitimate organizations usually don’t reach out unexpectedly. If you're unsure, hang up and contact the company directly.

**Have you been asked to share personal details?**

Never share personal information unless you can confirm who you’re talking to. Scammers want your data to steal your money or identity. Be cautious if asked to pay in unusual ways, like through Western Union or cryptocurrency.

**Are the contact details vague?**

Scam websites often lack clear contact information. Legitimate companies provide a physical address and phone number. Be wary of premium rate numbers (starting with **'09', '118', '0871', '0872' and '0873'**).

**Are you being asked to keep it secret?**

Fraudsters may ask you to keep things secret to isolate you from getting advice from friends or family. Always discuss important agreements with others for support.

**Is the offer too good to be true?**

If an offer promises high returns with little investment, it’s likely a scam. Trust your instincts—deals that seem too good to be true usually are.

**Are you being pressured to make a decision?**

Scammers often rush you to make quick decisions. Take your time to think things over. Genuine companies allow you space to make informed choices.

**Are there spelling and grammar mistakes?**

Emails with many mistakes are likely scams. Legitimate organizations rarely make these errors.


**How to verify the authenticity of emails and messages**

- **Check the Sender's Email Address**:  
    Look closely at the email address. Ensure it matches the official domain of the organization. Watch for misspellings or strange domains. Domains are the official links to an organisation's website (e.g. Google.com using Gmail. Icloud.com with Apple.) 
    
- **Look for Red Flags**:  
    Read the email for suspicious language, grammar mistakes, or unprofessional formatting. Be cautious of urgent requests or generic greetings.
    
- **Verify the Email Header**:  
    Access the email header to check its origin. This can reveal the email’s path and any anomalies.
    
- **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments**:  
    Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Hover over links to check the URL (the link on the screen) first.
    
- **Use Email Verification Tools**:  
    Utilize online tools to verify the credibility (if it's trustworthy) of email addresses and domains.

Conclusion
Verifying email sources is important for your safety online. Stay observant, educate yourself about scams, and use tools to protect against cyber threats. A cautious approach helps maintain a secure online environment.

**legitimate vs. phishing emails**

![Picture 4](../images/RealTaxEmail.jpg)

This is a legitimate email. We can see this by looking at the sender address. The email domain is a gov.im one, showing that it is from the Government. 
Next, from the words "Thank you for your email", we can see that this response was expected.
To sign off the email, the sender has stated his name, address of the building, a telephone number, and an email address which is linked. By looking up the address and phone number, we would be able to see that this is legitimate information. And, as I have stated above, the email address provided, is one that we can trust. 

![Picture 5](../images/RealTaxEmailHeader.jpg)

As we can see, the "From" email address is trusted ("gov.im"), and the "to" email address is my own, correct address.
"Mailed-by" and "signed by" both match. And "security" has a padlock next to it with "Standard encryption (TLS)". 


![Picture 6](../images/FacebookScam2.jpg)

This is a standard scam email. The subject of this email includes an emoji. It is a small indicator, but it is worth noting. Legitimate emails will not use emojis, so be sure to look out for them!
The sender's address is not Facebooks actual company email. We know this by the fact that "Facebook" is spaced out in the address and that there is a string of letters that follow it. 
It then proceeds to inform us that a new device has attempted to log into the account from India. They say this because they want us to panic and make a mistake by clicking on the buttons they provided, so we may retrieve our account details. 
The text underneath the email states "Not interested in receiving emails like this? Unsubscribe here". This is another attempt at getting you to click a link to a fake website. Ask yourself, why would I be interested in not receiving emails about my accounts being breached?
The address provided is also an incorrect address. 1 Facebook Way is not where the company's building is located. Ironically, the correct address for Facebook is 1 Hacker Way. 

![Picture 7](../images/FacebookScam2Header.jpg)

We can clearly see this is a scam email from the "from" and "to" addresses. I've covered why the sender's address is incorrect. The address the email has been sent to, is not my own personal email address. 
The "mailed-by" and "signed by" do not match. This indicates that this is a spam email.
Unfortunately, this email does have standard encryption. But, this doesn't always mean that the email is safe. 
## **What is Phishing?**

**Definition of phishing:**

Phishing is a fraudulent act where scammers send emails or messages pretending to be from well-known companies or people. Their goal is to trick you into revealing personal information, like passwords and credit card details.

**Examples of phishing emails, messages, and websites**

![Picture 8](../images/FacebookScamHeader.jpg)

What can you see here?
Well, there are a number of issues but, let us start from the top. There is a small drop down button where we can see who sent the email, and who they sent it to. You may see it being sent to your email address and think that it is from a legitimate sender, but, lets take a look at that sender's email address. Does that seem right to you? I don't think so! Additionally, the word "Facebook" is all separated. Therefore, this is a scam email!

Additionally, this is not my email address, so there is another red flag.

![Picture 9](../images/FacebookScam.jpg)

On the email, we can clearly see there is a big ""report phishing" banner across the top. This is unlikely to pop up on a legitimate email. Email providers such as Outlook and Gmail have programmed their systems to search for scam/phishing emails in order to stop people falling for these tricks. 

Next on the email is the use of name. Of course, my name on Facebook wouldn't be "Jgunner". It would be my actual name.

The English in this email is very well crafted however, they did slip up. It is very minor but it is worth noting. They asked "

		We noticed a login from a device you don't usually use  
  
		Windows 10. Mumbai, India  
  
		If this was you, you can safety disregard this email."

But then, they put buttons on the bottom to say "Report the user", who will I be reporting? Myself? Or the other options is, "Yes, ,me" that is not very good English.

What Should you do if you see an email like this? 

Report phishing. Dont click anywhere within the email. If you are unsure, look for the three dots in the top corner and do it from there. 

![Picture 10](../images/ReportPhishing.jpg)

I will show one more phishing tactic before moving onto some of the common tactics.

Shown below, is a fake message from a Youtuber. The image is not mine because I've not had the misfortune of being messaged in this way, however, we can pick it apart.

![Picture 11](../images/FamousScam.jpg)

First of all, let's look at the username. Is this the type of username you would expect a famous person to use? This username has the word "bot" included, showing that this is not a legitimate account.
Next, we look at the amount of followers/followings the account has. Someone that is famous would have a significant following, accounts that don't, tend to be fake accounts which are recently set up, with the intention of tricking you/a fan.
Now, we can dissect the message. "My dear subscriber!" shows that this is a copy/paste message. Real messages would address your username or real name. This message mentions a "raffle", which, if you haven't entered into one, you wouldn't win. They ask you to add them on Steam (a social platform), this is something that a famous person would never do, as this is a more personal platform, mostly used to keep in contact with family.
Lastly, the link provided is a false one. The word "Steam" is misspelled. In addition to this, you can always hover over the link, using a browser, to confirm where the link is sending you. 
After confirming a false account/message, always report the account and delete the message. Never click on anything within the message.

![Picture 12](../images/InstagramScam.jpg)

This is a little trickier to figure out if it's a fake message or not. But, that's okay, we will go through it together.
Firstly, Instagram would not message you on their platform regarding "suspicious activity". They would opt to email you, instead. Also, the username of "instagram" is not capitalised, showing that this is not the actual platform contacting you. Additionally, there is no blue tick next to the username, indicating that this is not a verified account.
Below the message, we can see that the user is asked if they "want to let Instagrammer send you messages?". This is not a legitimate username, it also doesn't match the name at the top.
The message itself doesn't really have any issues with it, especially not with grammar or spelling. The only thing we should note is the lack of personally addressing the user. "Hello!" is very generic and doesn't inform you that they are trying to contact you.
They are using urgent language in an attempt to force the user to quickly click the link to save their account. They give a time frame of "48 hours" until the account is deactivated. Legitimate Instagram wouldn't do this. If they thought that your account had suspicious activity, they would immediately deal with it, and delete your account.
They attempt to scare the user by informing them that they can't make "any changes to your account such as username, password, email, or phone number". This message is trying to make you believe that the only way your account can be saved, is by clicking the harmful link that they provided.

![Picture 13](../images/InstagramCommentScam.jpg)

This scam is fairly easy to notice. 
The username wouldn't usually be one that you would recognise. It may present itself as a name you don't know, or a random assortment of characters and numbers.
Once again, you have "won" something that you didn't sign up for. This user is, very clearly, trying to prompt you to click a link.
The multiple dotted lines are an attempt to create the impression that this message is intended solely for you, however, scrolling down, you can see multiple tagged accounts. Showing that this isn't just for you, in fact, they are attempting to trick multiple users.
Furthermore, this would usually appear with a "See more" button, giving it the impression that it is just for you, as this hides the other users' names.
The "See more" button is also used in hopes that you will accidently click on the link.


**Common tactics used in phishing**

Phishing is when attackers try to steal your personal information, like usernames, passwords, or bank details, often using threatening language. For example, they might say, "Send me £200 to save these puppies." Don't be fooled by threats—they're meaningless.

Phishing messages may seem urgent and often contain spelling mistakes, though these are becoming less common due to AI. Scammers promote "once in a lifetime offers" that come with strange links, which are empty promises designed to steal your data. If you receive a phishing email that looks like it's from Facebook, check for signs of a fake site:

- It should start with **HTTPS://**.
- There should be a padlock icon at the beginning of the URL.
- If you doubt a website's authenticity, it probably isn’t real.
- Use online tools such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to test authenticity of a website

## **Types of Phishing**

**Email Phishing**

The most common form of phishing, where scammers send emails pretending to be trusted companies. They often copy email formats and include harmful links or attachments to steal personal information.

**How to Identify Email Phishing:**
- **Requests for Personal Info**: Legitimate companies never ask for sensitive information via email.
- **Urgent Messages**: Scammers create a sense of urgency (e.g., account breaches) to provoke immediate action. Always verify through official channels.
- **Shortened Links**: These can mask harmful URL's. Avoid clicking on them without verification.
- **Non-Domain Addresses**: Check if the sender's email matches the official company domain.
- **Spelling & Grammar Mistakes**: Poorly written emails often indicate phishing.
- **Attachments**: Be cautious with unexpected attachments, especially .exe or .zip files.
- **Single or Blank Images**: If the email features just an image without text, it might contain malware.

A targeted approach focusing on specific individuals or organizations. Scammers use personal information to craft believable emails.

**How to Identify Spear Phishing:**
- **Unusual Requests**: Verify requests for sensitive information with the person directly.
- **Shared Drive Links**: Be wary of unexpected links to shared drives.
- **Unsolicited Emails**: If you didn’t request a document, verify before downloading.

- **Lack of Interaction History**: Be wary of accounts with few followers or posts.

**Website Spoofing**  
Fake websites copy legitimate ones to steal information.

**How to Identify Website Spoofing:**

-URL is the web address you are visiting (E.g. www.example.com is a URL).
- **Website Errors**: Disordered or pixelated logos should raise suspicion.

**Email Spoofing/Username Spoofing**  
Scammers create fake email domains to appear legitimate.

**How to Identify Domain Spoofing:**
- **Unsolicited Emails**: Verify unexpected emails through other channels.
- **Email Address Misspellings**: Be aware of homograph attacks in domain names. (E.g. 3 for an E, or 0 for an O)


## **Staying Safe Online**

- **Use Strong Passwords**:
    - Create complex passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and special symbols. ($%*@#)
    - Avoid using easily guessable information, such as birthdays or common words.
    - Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for different accounts. (BitWarden, Nord pass, and LastPass)
    
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
    - Whenever possible, activate 2FA for your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (like a text message code or authentication app) in addition to your password.
    - Be aware of different methods of 2FA and choose one that suits your needs (e.g., SMS codes, authenticator apps, or hardware tokens).
    
- **Limit Personal Information Sharing**:
    - Be mindful of the information you share on social media and public forums. Scammers can use this information to target you.
    - Regularly review privacy settings on social media accounts to control who can see your personal information.
    
- **Use Secure Connections**:
    - Ensure that any website you enter sensitive information on uses HTTPS. Look for the padlock icon in the address bar.
    - Avoid using public Wi-Fi for transactions or accessing sensitive information. If necessary, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for added security.
    
- **Regularly Monitor Accounts**:
    - Keep an eye on your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. Report suspicious activity immediately.
    - Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services for additional monitoring and alerts.


## **Best practices for handling suspicious emails and messages**

- **Don’t Click Links or Download Attachments**:
    - Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. These could contain malware or lead to phishing sites.
    
- **Verify the Sender**:
    - Check the sender’s email address carefully. Look for misspellings or unusual domains that might indicate a spoofed email.
    - If in doubt, contact the person or organization through a verified method (e.g., official website or phone number) to confirm the email’s legitimacy.
    
- **Look for Red Flags**:
    - Be cautious of urgent requests, generic greetings, or poor grammar and spelling in emails, as these are common signs of phishing attempts.
    
- **Report Suspicious Messages**:
    - Most email services allow users to report phishing emails. Reporting helps improve security measures and protect others.
    
- **Educate Yourself and Others**:
    - Stay informed about common phishing tactics and share this knowledge with friends and family to help them recognize and avoid scams.


## **Importance of keeping software and antivirus programs up to date**

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
    - Software updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that could be used by attackers. Keeping your software up to date reduces the risk of being attacked.
    
1. **Enhanced Features and Performance**:
    - Updates may also improve software performance and provide new features that enhance user experience. Regular updates ensure you’re getting the most out of your software.
    
1. **Antivirus Updates**:
    - Antivirus programs rely on up-to-date databases of known threats. Regularly updating your antivirus software helps it effectively find and reduce the latest malware and threats.
    
1. **Operating System Updates**:
    - Ensure your operating system is updated to protect against known exploits. Many cyberattacks target outdated systems because they are easier to attack and get through.
    
1. **Backup Data Regularly**:
    - In addition to keeping software updated, regularly back up important data. This can help reduce the impact of a ransomware attack or data loss due to a security breach.
    

By following these practices, you can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyber threats and better protect your personal information.

## **What to Do If You Suspect Phishing or Scamming**
- **Stay Calm**:
    - Don’t panic if you receive a suspicious email or message. Take a moment to assess the situation carefully.
    
- **Do Not Click Links or Download Attachments**:
    - Avoid interacting with any links or attachments in the suspicious email. This is crucial to prevent malware installation or data theft.
    -Malware is a software designed by criminals to steal data and damage or destroy computers.
    
- **Verify the Sender**:
    - Check the sender’s email address closely. Look for unusual characters, misspellings, or domain variations that suggest it may be fraudulent.
    - If the email appears to be from a known contact or organization, reach out to them directly through a separate communication method to confirm.
    
- **Report the Email**:
    - Use your email provider's reporting tools to report the phishing attempt. This helps improve spam filters and protect other users.
    - Many email clients have a “Report Spam” or “Report Phishing” option. Use this feature to alert the provider.
    
- **Delete the Email**:
    - After reporting, delete the email from your inbox to avoid accidental interaction in the future.
    
- **Monitor Your Accounts**:
    - Keep an eye on your financial accounts and personal information for any suspicious activity. Consider changing passwords for any accounts you think may have been compromised.

## **How to report scams to authorities or organizations**
- **Report to Your Email Provider**:
    - Most email providers, like Gmail or Outlook, have built-in reporting features for phishing and spam. Use these tools to flag suspicious emails.
    - 
- **File a Complaint with Authorities**:
    - In the U.K., report scams to Action Fraud via their website or by calling 0300 123 2040.
    - 
- **Report to Anti-Phishing Organizations**:
    - Organizations like the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) accept reports of phishing attempts. You can forward suspicious emails to report@apwg.org.
    
- **Notify Financial Institutions**:
    - If you suspect that a phishing attempt may affect your bank or credit card information, contact your financial institution immediately to inform them of the situation.

- **Local Consumer Protection Agencies**:
    - Check for local consumer protection agencies that can provide additional assistance and may also collect reports on scams in your area.
    
- **Social Media Reporting**:
    - If the phishing attempt comes through social media, report the account or message to the platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) using their reporting tools.
