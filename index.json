[{"categories":null,"content":"My first box on HTB","date":"2023-08-30","objectID":"/blog/meow/meow/","tags":null,"title":"HTB: Meow","uri":"/blog/meow/meow/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction I have performed my first HackTheBox machine called “Meow”, this is of course a starting point box allowing me to get used to using these machines and how they work. I will also be using my own machine to hack these boxes. My current machine is running Parrot OS on VMware. Firstly we must answer a couple of questions before we hack this machine. Task 1 The first answer is Virtual Machine. Task 2 The next answer is Terminal, using Linux it is one of the most common tools that will be used, in order to fulfil tasks. Task 3 Using HTB and THM you will most likely be using OpenVPN in order to continue using the boxes. Task 4 To test our connection with a box you use an ICMP echo request called ping Starting point - Ping The first action you should perform on any of these boxes is ping to ensure that you are connect to the box and also HTB. So you will need to perform ping machineIP Once we know that the machine is connected we can continue with the machine. Task 5 The next tool we will be using is nmap. Nmap gives us plenty of options which we will explore in other boxes that I will complete later on this website. Using Nmap The next action being taken will be an nmap scan. This scan will consist of using -sV; a scan allowing myself to see the services running on certain ports and their version. I also use -vv; this allows the scan to increase verbosity significantly. The scan will look like nmap -sV -vv machineIP Nmap Result Once the scan has finished we will then see a list of results. It is quite long however I have taken a snippet of the most important part. Which will show us the ports and services running on those ports. As you can see here, there is only 1 port visibly open and it is telnet which would allow us to answer our next task. Task 6 As we can see in the above scan that port 23 is telnet so therefore we have now answered our next task but we must now set up to use this service to penetrate further into the box. Telnet We now use the terminal in order to login to telnet using the command telnet machineIP Task 7 The final answerable question is looking for the username for which does not require a password on telnet which is root. Telnet Login I then login to telnet using the default credential of root and was instantly allowed access with root privileges we can now access the ls command to see what files are accessible: We can clearly see there is a flag.txt file which is what our last task is on HTB, we will need to cat into this file providing the command cat flag.txt This will allow us to see the flag. Finish This was the final stage to the first box to be done on HackTheBox, it was quite nice and easy and a good introduction with what is to come with this website. Thank you for reading and I hope you have learnt something as well.

This was followed by a master’s degree in the same field of cyber security. I became interested in and started practicing computing back in 2014, which continued throughout college. This opened me up to the realm of cyber security and, in time, ethical hacking. Outside of my academic pursuits, I spend my time gaming, but I also love to learn and study. That’s why I decided to create this website - to enable me to possess a virtual space to reflect on my academic journey and progress, primarily my capture the flag events and challenges provided by websites such as TryHackMe.com and HackTheBox.com. This website also allows me to showcase any ongoing projects that I am currently doing. This will serve as a method of tracking my own progression, while also offering the potential to help others who are on similar paths to me. I am well versed in many areas of IT, and my knowledge in these areas are diverse. From experimenting with web design and programming (Python and C). I am currently attempting to delve deeper with Python and C, while also exploring new languages such as Rust, Node/JS and C++ and C#. My interests extend beyond coding. I have successfully built computers from scratch and have provided IT support. This encompasses assisting with repairs and supplying basic guides and installs for beginner users. Looking forward, I am determined to enter the field of offensive security, though I remain open to jobs on the defensive security side. My philosophy is simple “Follow your passions, and success will follow.” ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About Jamie","uri":"/about/"}]
