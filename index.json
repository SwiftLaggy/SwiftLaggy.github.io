I have been doing computing from 2014 which I continued through college, this lead me onto cyber security and lastly onto ethical hacking which is an area I really enjoy. In my own time I play a lot of games however I also love to study which is why I have created this website, because I would like to go over my studies; primarily my capture the flag events and ones provided by websites such as TryHackMe.com and HackTheBox.com, I would also like to go over projects that I am currently doing as a way that I can see my own progression but may also help others!. I have dabbled in lots of areas of IT some of which I have enjoyed thoroughly such as web design and creation as well as programming (Python and C); I am currently trying to go in more depth with Python and C, but I am also trying to learn a few more such as Rust, Node/JS and the other C’s (C++ and C#). I have also built computers and done IT support which included repairs as well as basic guides and installs for beginner users. I am currently looking for an opportunity within the offensive security area however I am not fussy for jobs as I do enjoy defensive security as well, my outlook is “if you are happy continue doing what you want to do”.
