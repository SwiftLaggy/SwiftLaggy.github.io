[{"categories":null,"content":"My first box on HTB","date":"2023-08-30","objectID":"/blog/meow/meow/","tags":null,"title":"HTB: Meow","uri":"/blog/meow/meow/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction I have performed my first HackTheBox machine called “Meow”, this is of course a starting point box allowing me to get used to using these machines and how they work. I will also be using my own machine to hack these boxes. My current machine is running Parrot OS on VMware. Firstly we must answer a couple of questions before we hack this machine. Task 1 The first answer is Virtual Machine. Task 2 The next answer is Terminal, using Linux it is one of the most common tools that will be used, in order to fulfil tasks. Task 3 Using HTB and THM you will most likely be using OpenVPN in order to continue using the boxes. Task 4 To test our connection with a box you use an ICMP echo request called ping Starting point - Ping The first action you should perform on any of these boxes is ping to ensure that you are connect to the box and also HTB. So you will need to perform ping machineIP. Once we know that the machine is connected we can continue with the machine. Task 5 The next tool we will be using is nmap. Nmap gives us plenty of options which we will explore in other boxes that I will complete later on this website. Using Nmap The next action being taken will be an nmap scan. This scan will consist of using -sV; a scan allowing myself to see the services running on certain ports and their version. I also use -vv; this allows the scan to increase verbosity significantly. The scan will look like nmap -sV -vv machineIP. Nmap Result Once the scan has finished we will then see a list of results. It is quite long however I have taken a snippet of the most important part. Which will show us the ports and services running on those ports. As you can see here, there is only 1 port visibly open and it is telnet which would allow us to answer our next task. Task 6 As we can see in the above scan that port 23 is telnet so therefore we have now answered our next task but we must now set up to use this service to penetrate further into the box. Telnet We now use the terminal in order to login to telnet using the command telnet machineIP. Task 7 The final answerable question is looking for the username for which does not require a password on telnet which is root. Telnet Login I then login to telnet using the default credential of root and was instantly allowed access with root privileges we can now access the ls command to see what files are accessible: We can clearly see there is a flag.txt file which is what our last task is on HTB, we will need to cat into this file providing the command cat flag.txt. This will allow us to see the flag Finish This was the final stage to the first box to be done on HackTheBox, it was quite nice and easy and a good introduction with what is to come with this website. Thank you for reading and I hope you have learnt something as well.

I have been doing computing from 2014 which I continued through college, this lead me onto cyber security and lastly onto ethical hacking which is an area I really enjoy. In my own time I play a lot of games however I also love to study which is why I have created this website, because I would like to go over my studies; primarily my capture the flag events and ones provided by websites such as TryHackMe.com and HackTheBox.com, I would also like to go over projects that I am currently doing as a way that I can see my own progression but may also help others!. I have dabbled in lots of areas of IT some of which I have enjoyed thoroughly such as web design and creation as well as programming (Python and C); I am currently trying to go in more depth with Python and C, but I am also trying to learn a few more such as Rust, Node/JS and the other C’s (C++ and C#). I have also built computers and done IT support which included repairs as well as basic guides and installs for beginner users. I am currently looking for an opportunity within the offensive security area however I am not fussy for jobs as I do enjoy defensive security as well, my outlook is “if you are happy continue doing what you want to do”.
