This was a great introduction, as it allowed me to acclimatise to these machines and to understand how they function. In order for me to hack these boxes, I will be utilising my own personal machine, which is running Parrot OS on VMware. (You might see different IP’s listed in these write-ups. This is due to completing areas on different days.) Before we begin to hack this machine, we must first answer a couple of questions. Task 1 At the beginning of this task, it asks of you the explanation of the acronym SMB, which is Server Message Block. Task 2 Server Message Block lives on port 445 and port 139 when it is communicating over NetBIOS however, this is quite old and is not seen as often. Starting Point - Ping It is important that you are connected to the boxes before you can begin hacking them. We can do this by performing the command ping, followed by the machine’s IP. Below is an example of the command ping being performed: ping machineIP Using Nmap The next tool we will be using is nmap. Nmap gives us plenty of options, those of which, we will explore in other boxes that I will complete later on in this website. Below, you can see the scan in question: nmap -sV -vv machineIP Task 3 After completing our nmap scan, we can see there are three ports open however, as we know, SMB resides on port 445. We can see the service name on 445 is called microsoft-ds. SMB Help Within the terminal, I am now using a new service/application. Therefore, I want to look at the options I can use within the service to ensure I am using it correctly. The image above is actually an error message help screen however, you can get a better and more in-depth version using the -? or --help options. Task 4 As we can see from the above terminal screenshot, -L is the option we are looking for in order to list the available shares on the box. Task 5 Now, using the option, we can see there are 4 shares available on this box. Task 6 I made a small assumption from this point, that WorkShares was the share we could access without a password. It was also a huge hint from HTB however, it would be incredibly unsecure if they allowed anyone into the Admin or C drive. We can see within the WorkShares that there are two folder locations, Amy.J and James.P. We can access both of these. As shown in the screenshot below, the Amy folder possesses a text file called worknotes. In the next screenshots, we get the worknotes.txt file, and look inside to find a set of instructions however, this is most likely not important to us. However, in later boxes, it might be useful to remember that there is an Apache server, and they are in the process of securing the FTP server. Task 7 Lastly, as we saw in the previous task, we used the get command to download the files we want. In the screenshot below, we can see that James has our flat. So now we get flag.txt and then open it to get our flag and complete our next box. Final Thoughts This concludes the finishing stages for this box on HackTheBox. It provided a good insight into SMB, allowing me to learn the basics of SMB, how to traverse and obtain another flag. I have used SMB in the past for my university module, so this was not entirely new to me but, it was nice being able to revisit an old vulnerability. I would like to experience more with SMB and see what I can do with it in the future.

This was a great introduction, as it allowed me to acclimatise to these machines and to understand how they function. In order for me to hack these boxes, I will be utilising my own personal machine, which is running Parrot OS on VMware. Before we begin to hack this machine, we must first answer a couple of questions. Task 1 At the beginning of this task, it asks of you the explanation of the acronym FTP, which is File Transfer Protocol. Task 2 File Transfer Protocol is a network protocol available on port 20, which allows for the transfer of data, via a data channel and port 21, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts. Task 3 To continue the explanation of FTP, we have another protocol called SFTP, which stands for SSH, or secure File Transfer Protocol. This utilises port 22. Task 4 To test our connection with a box, you use an ICMP echo request called ping. Starting Point - Ping It is important that you are connected to the boxes before you can begin hacking them. We can do this by performing the command ping, followed by the machine’s IP. Below is an example of the command ping being performed: ping machineIP Using Nmap The next tool we will be using is nmap. Nmap gives us plenty of options, those of which, we will explore in other boxes that I will complete later on in this website. For this box, we are using a similar command to the one in the box Meow however, we now have the addition of -O. This is an option used to find the operating system. Below, you can see the scan in question: nmap -O -sV -vv machineIP Task 5 After using the nmap command we can see the port that FTP is on and the version of FTP. Task 6 We can see from the terminal below, that the operating system hosting the FTP server is Unix. Sometimes, the scan can be wrong, other times it will detect an operating system. However, it cannot give specifics as to what version it is, like Windows Server. Task 7 As with most commands, there are two ways of viewing a help menu. The first, would be using the -h option, leading you to the help area. The other, not specific in this box, would be man , followed the application you are using. FTP -h For your reference, here is a screenshot of the ftp -h command result within the terminal. FTP Help Within the FTP terminal itself, it will also provide you with another help menu for the specific command you can use in whatever scenario you might be in. Task 8 The standard version of FTP has its own anonymous account, allowing a non-account holder the ability to view files however, the secure version does not have this option available immediately; it needs to be enabled. FTP Login We now use the terminal in order to login to ftp using the command: ftp machineIP Then, you can type in “anonymous” for the username with no password and it will allow you to traverse the file structure. Task 9 As you can see in the screenshot above, the ‘Login successful’ response code is 230. Task 10 In a Linux filesystem, you will be using the ls command to look at the current file structure/directory. There are, of course, a large number of options you can utilise to expand your search through this file structure, such as -a for all including hidden files. Task 11 I was not overly familiar with FTP, so I had to use the help command with the FTP terminal to learn the get option. Using get will allow you to download the file you are viewing. As you can see, after downloading the file, we can access it using a text editor on the .txt file and obtain the flag. Final Thoughts This concludes the finishing stages on this box on HackTheBox. It provided a good insight into FTP, allowing me to learn the basics of FTP and obtain another flag. This newfound interest has sparked a curiosity, and I would like to see some exploits with FTP and SFTP.

Considering that this was the first of many challenges, it was quite an arduous task. After attempting to complete this, my team and I had realised that we may not have trained enough for this CTF challenge. Despite this, I wanted to give a small write up detailing what we managed to accomplish as this was a considerably enjoyable challenge. The Email Within the challenge .ZIP folder contained a singular .TXT email file. We can see in this email that it covers many areas. The first email holds a lot of information, starting with Jenny’s “jfeng@veryrealmail.com”. Then, we have her personal information: Date of Birth: 02/08/1990 Postal Code: 00100 Weight: 61kg Next, we can see the email provides us with a .ZIP but it is password protected. The problem that we are faced with, is that we have not been provided this password as it was in their previous emails. We are also provided with another attachment, which appears to be a receipt, asking us to make sure the (m)data is correct, assuming this could be meta data, maybe steganography. The main problem currently, is that we do not have access to either attachment, but it does provide us with 2 Base64 strings. One of which is far too long to input on this website however, I can paste the other. The First Base64 UEsDBDMAAQBjABt3Q1cAAAAAPwAAACMAAAAIAAsAZmxhZy50eHQBmQcAAgBBRQMAALXlHmkDJrqpuC6UsKfMRf0ryv1ot/Vf0o0rJl7iNPv+pINt/HGY9cx7/J7HpS5xfce96yETu2enDZD+8nLU31BLAQI/ADMAAQBjABt3Q1cAAAAAPwAAACMAAAAIAC8AAAAAAAAAIAAAAAAAAABmbGFnLnR4dAoAIAAAAAAAAQAYANdGZhT59dkBWFt5Lfn12QFO9TAOV8XZAQGZBwACAEFFAwAAUEsFBgAAAAABAAEAZQAAAHAAAAAAAA== Once this is put into Cyberchef, we are given a very odd string: But the email states it is Base64 encoding. I then noticed that it is a .ZIP as previously stated. So, I did some research and found Base64 to file from Base64 guru. This website gave us Application.zip containing a .TXT file however, it seems to be password protected with no password in sight. There must be a password. I continued on as I would normally, with the information that there was a password given previously. Maybe it could be elsewhere, perhaps the metadata of the .PNG of the next Base64 encoding. As expected, Cyberchef could not decode it as it is an image however, one must test these things. The Second Base64 As cyberchef had an issue, I had to find another alternative. As we were loading an image from Base64, it was only natural to go for a Base64 to image. So I found a website with such services and it returned: Stenography We were told “(m)data”; I believe this to be the meta data. So, I loaded up my Kali Linux machine with a stenography tool and looked at the meta data. I could use basic websites, but I prefer to perfect the skills with tools rather than use websites. I decided to use an easy tool, as I was only searching the meta data. As explained in the Copyright field, there is a password format, “birthDateMail***R3ply!”. It was specified by the creators. The asterixis’ are random characters/symbols, which means we have a base password format with 3 random characters. We have all the information and this would be: ``` 900802jfeng@veryrealmail.com***R3ply! But what are the three characters? I had to write a script on Python in order to cover every possible combination. Python Program import itertools import string email_address = \"900802jfeng@veryrealmail.com***R3ply!\" characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + \"!@#$%^\u0026*()-_=+[]{}|;:'\\\",.\u003c\u003e?/\\\\~`\" # Alphabets, numbers, and special characters # Find asterisk positions asterisk_positions = [pos for pos, char in enumerate(email_address) if char == \"*\"] # Generate combinations of single characters combinations = itertools.product(characters, repeat=len(asterisk_positions)) #output file name output_file = \"email_combinations.txt\" # Open the file for writing with open(output_file, \"w\") as file: # Iterate through the comb","date":"2023-10-16","objectID":"/blog/misc/misc/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Miscellaneous Challenge","uri":"/blog/misc/misc/"},{"categories":null,"content":"My first box on HTB","date":"2023-08-30","objectID":"/blog/meow/meow/","tags":null,"title":"HTB: Meow","uri":"/blog/meow/meow/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction I was successful in completing my first HackTheBox machine, by the name of “Meow”. This was a great introduction, as it allowed me to acclimatise to these machines and to understand how they function. In order for me to hack these boxes, I will be utilising my own personal machine, which is running Parrot OS on VMware. Before we begin to hack this machine, we must first answer a couple of questions. Task 1 This is a relatively simple question, with the answer being Virtual Machine. Task 2 The next answer is Terminal. With the usage of Linux, Terminal is going to be one of the more commonly used tools, aiding me to fulfil tasks. Task 3 Using HTB and THM, you will most likely be using OpenVPN in order to continue using the boxes. Task 4 To test our connection with a box, you use an ICMP echo request called ping. Starting point - Ping It is important that you are connected to the boxes, before you can begin hacking them. We can do this by performing the command ping, followed by the machine’s IP. Below is an example of the command ping being performed: ping machineIP Once we know that the machine is connected, we can continue with the machine. Task 5 The next tool we will be using is nmap. Nmap gives us plenty of options, those of which, we will explore in other boxes that I will complete later on, in this website. Using Nmap The next action being taken will be an nmap scan. This scan will consist of using -sV; a scan allowing myself to see the services running on certain ports and their version. I also use -vv; this allows the scan to increase verbosity significantly. Below, you can see the scan in question: nmap -sV -vv machineIP Nmap Result Once the scan has been concluded, we will then see a list of results. It is of considerable length however, I have taken a snippet of the most important part. This will showcase the ports and services running on these. Evidently, there is only 1 port visibly. This is telnet, and it allows us to answer our next task. Task 6 As we can see in the above scan, port 23 is telnet. This means, we have now answered our next task. Our next step is to prepare to use this service in order to penetrate further into the bo Telnet We now use the terminal in order to login to telnet using the command: telnet machineIP Task 7 The final question is looking for the username which doesn’t require a password on telnet, for which the answer is root. Telnet Login Using the the default credential of root, I can then login to telnet and instantly be allowed access with root privileges. Upon completion of this step, we can now access the 1s command to view the accessible files: I then login to telnet using the default credential of root and was instantly allowed access with root privileges we can now access the ls command to see what files are accessible: As showcased below, we can see that there is a flag.txt file. This contains the final flag to complete this box. In order to print the contents of the file, we must use the cat command: We can clearly see there is a flag.txt file which is what our last task is on HTB, we will need to cat into this file providing the command cat flag.txt This will allow us to see the flag. Finish This concludes the finishing stages for the first box on HackTheBox. It proved to be a pleasant introduction and provides a good insight for what the future of this website will hold. I have learnt the basics of telnet and found it rather interesting to engage with. This newfound interest has sparked a curiosity, and I would like to see some exploits with telnet. Thank you for reading and joining me on my first post, and I hope you learned something too!
